Nmap is a network scanner that used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending packets and analyzing the responses.
Nmap can help you to quickly map out a network, identify the devices and services running on it, detect the operating system and version of the targets, find open ports and vulnerabilities, and perform various attacks or exploits.
