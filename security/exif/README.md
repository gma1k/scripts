EXIF data is a type of metadata that is stored in digital images. 
It stands for Exchangeable Image File and it contains information about the camera, the settings, the location, the date and time, and other details of the photo. 

It is very important to delete or fake EXIF data before you post it online because EXIF data can reveal a lot of information about you and your pictures that you may not want to share with others. 
For example, EXIF data can contain:
Camera settings: This can show what kind of camera or device you used, how you adjusted the exposure, focus, flash, etc. This can reveal your level of skill or preference as a photographer, or the quality of your equipment.
Image metrics: This can show the pixel dimensions, resolution, colorspace, and filesize of your picture. This can reveal how much you edited or compressed your picture, or what software you used.
Date and time information: This can show when and where you took the picture. This can reveal your habits, schedule, location history, etc.
Location information: This can show the GPS coordinates of where you took the picture. This can reveal your exact location, such as your home address, workplace, school, etc. This can also show the direction and altitude of your camera.
Thumbnail: This can show a smaller version of your picture that is embedded in the EXIF data. This can reveal what your picture looks like even if you delete or modify the original picture.
Descriptions: This can show any text or comments that you added to your picture, such as a title, caption, keywords, rating, etc. This can reveal your thoughts, opinions, emotions, etc.
Copyright information: This can show who owns the rights to your picture, such as your name, contact information, license terms, etc. This can reveal your identity or legal status.
